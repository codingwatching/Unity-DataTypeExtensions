## [1.0.2] - 2026-04-26

**New**:
- Added `CLAUDE.md` wrapper at the package root that imports `AGENTS.md` for Claude Code integration
- Added `MockValidatableConfigAlt` test fixture sibling type to support singleton + collection validation scenarios

**Changes**:
- Trimmed `README.md` from 477 lines to a leaner Option B shape (one canonical example per feature, ~209 lines), with a Related docs footer and unpinned installation git URL
- `AGENTS.md`: added Companion-files blockquote, acknowledged PlayMode tests under `Tests/PlayMode/` alongside EditMode in Section 6, and documented the one-role-per-type invariant on `ConfigsProvider._configs` (a type can be registered as either a singleton or a keyed collection, never both)
- Synced Unity-regenerated `.meta` files for `CHANGELOG.md`, `Editor`, `LICENSE.md`, `README.md`, `Runtime`, `Tests`, `Tests/Editor`, and `package.json`

**Fixes**:
- Fixed `ConfigValidationServiceTests.ValidateAll_ReportsFieldsAndConfigIds` which threw `ArgumentException` by registering `MockValidatableConfig` as both a singleton and a keyed collection; now uses two distinct sibling types to preserve the original test intent

---

## [1.0.1] - 2026-02-06

**New**:
- Added new unit tests for `ConfigTreeBuilder`, `ConfigValidationService`, and `ConfigsEditorUtil`

**Changes**:
- Decomposed monolithic `ConfigBrowserWindow` and `MigrationPanelElement` into MVC architecture
- Simplified `README.md` by removing the inline package structure and contents

---

## [1.0.0] - 2026-01-21

**New**:

- Added `ConfigsSerializer` for JSON serialization with backend sync support
- Added `ConfigsScriptableObject` for ScriptableObject-based config containers
- Added `IConfigsProvider`, `IConfigsAdder`, `IConfigsContainer` interfaces
- Added Newtonsoft.Json dependency for serialization
- Added Unity 6 UI Toolkit support for `ReadOnlyPropertyDrawer` and `EnumSelectorPropertyDrawer` with IMGUI fallback for custom inspector compatibility
- Added `Runtime/link.xml` to prevent code stripping of core serialization logic
- Added Newtonsoft JSON converters for `Color`, `Vector2`, `Vector3`, `Vector4`, and `Quaternion` to `ConfigsSerializer`
- Added `ComputedField<T>` for derived observables with automatic dependency tracking, with fluent `Select` and `CombineWith` extension methods 
- Added `ObservableHashSet<T>` collection type with observation and batch support
- Added `ObservableBatch` to scope/batch observable updates
- Added `Configs.Validation` framework with `[Required]`, `[Range]`, and `[MinLength]` attributes
- Added Editor-only config validation tooling (`EditorConfigValidator`, `ValidationResult`)
- Added `Secure` serialization mode to `ConfigsSerializer` for safe remote payloads
- Added config schema migration framework (Editor-only) and migration window (`MigrationRunner`, `IConfigMigration`, `ConfigMigrationAttribute`)
- Added unified Config Browser editor tooling (window + UI Toolkit elements)
- Added ScriptableObject inspector tooling for config containers (`ConfigsScriptableObjectInspector`)
- Added Observable Debugger editor tooling and debug registry (`ObservableDebugWindow`, `ObservableDebugRegistry`)
- Added observable resolver types (`ObservableResolverField`, `ObservableResolverList`, `ObservableResolverDictionary`)

**Changes**:
- **BREAKING**: Package renamed from `com.gamelovers.dataextensions` to `com.gamelovers.gamedata`
- Improved IL2CPP/AOT safety for `SerializableType<T>` with better type resolution
- Optimized `EnumSelector` with static dictionary caching and O(1) lookups
- `IConfigBackendService` now uses `UniTask` instead of `System.Threading.Tasks.Task` for async operations (`GetRemoteVersion`, `FetchRemoteConfiguration`)
- Added `com.cysharp.unitask` (2.5.10) as a package dependency

**Fixes**:
- Fixed `EnumSelector.SetSelection` to correctly handle enums with explicit/non-contiguous values

---

## [0.7.0] - 2025-11-03

**New**:
- Added `Rebind` functionality to all Observable classes (`ObservableField`, `ObservableList`, `ObservableDictionary`) allowing rebinding to new data sources without losing existing observers
- Added `Rebind` methods to all Observable Resolver classes (`ObservableResolverField`, `ObservableResolverList`, `ObservableResolverDictionary`) to rebind to new origin collections and resolver functions
- Added new `IObservableResolverField` interface with `Rebind` method for resolver field implementations

## [0.6.7] - 2025-04-07

**New**:
- Added the `UnityObjectExtensions` to help add extra logic to Unity's `GameObject` type objects

## [0.6.6] - 2024-11-30

**Fixes**:
- `ObservableDictionary.Remove(T)` no longer sends an update if id doesn't find the element to remove it

## [0.6.5] - 2024-11-20

**Fixes**:
- Fixed the issues of `ObservableDictionary` when subscribing/unsubscribing to actions while removing/adding elements
- Fixed the issues of `ObservableList` when subscribing/unsubscribing to actions while removing/adding elements

## [0.6.4] - 2024-11-13

**Fixes**:
- Fixed the unit tests for `ObservableDictionary` that was preventing some builds to run

## [0.6.3] - 2024-11-02

**Fixes**:
- Fixed the compilation issues of `ObservableDictionary`

## [0.6.2] - 2024-11-02

**New**:
- Added the `ObservableUpdateFlag` to help performance when updating subscribers to the `ObservableDictionary`. By default is set `ObservableUpdateFlag.KeyUpdateOnly`

**Fixes**:
- Fixed an issue that would no setup Remove update action to Subscribers when calling `Clear` on the `ObservableDictionary`

## [0.6.1] - 2024-11-01

**Fixes**:
- Fixed an issue that would crash the execution when calling `Remove()` & `RemoveOrigin` from `ObservableResolverDictionary`

## [0.6.0] - 2023-08-05

**Changes**:
- Improved the `ObservableResolverList` and `ObservableResolverDictionary` data types to properly resolve lists and dictionaries with different data types from the original collection.

## [0.5.1] - 2023-09-04

**Fixes**:
- Added StructPair data type to support both object and struct type containers, improving memory usage performance.

**Fixes**:
- Fixed the dispose extension methods for GameObject and Object, removing pragma directives and adding null reference check in GetValid method to avoid unwanted exceptions

## [0.5.0] - 2023-08-05

**Fixes**:
- Added **floatP**, a deterministic floating-point number type, enhancing precision and predictability in mathematical operations. Including arithmetic and comparison operators for floatP to support complex calculations and conversion methods between floatP and float types.

## [0.4.0] - 2023-07-30

**Fixes**:
- Added utility methods and extensions for Unity's Object and GameObject types, enhancing the codebase's functionality.
